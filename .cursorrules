# Cursor Rules Configuration

## Active Rules
- **review-cleanup**: Review & Clean Up Codebase
  - Located at: `.cursor/rules/review-cleanup.md`
  - Activates code quality analysis and cleanup recommendations

## Usage
When working with this codebase, Cursor will automatically apply the review-cleanup rule to:
- Detect unused code and imports
- Suggest modern TypeScript/React best practices
- Improve test quality and accessibility
- Optimize performance and maintainability

The rule is now active and will guide code improvements during development.
