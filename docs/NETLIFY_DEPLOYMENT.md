# Netlify Manual Upload Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

## Build Steps

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the project (and optional ZIP):**
   - Build only:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - Build and create `site.zip` ready for Netlify manual upload:
     ```bash
     npm run build:zip
     ```

3. **Verify build output:**
   - Check that the `dist/` folder was created
   - Ensure `dist/index.html` exists
   - Verify all assets are in `dist/assets/`
   - Confirm `dist/_redirects` exists (it is copied automatically from `public/_redirects`)

## Manual Upload to Netlify

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign in**

2. **Drag and Drop Deployment:**
   - Option A: Drag the entire `dist/` folder to the Netlify dashboard
   - Option B: Upload the `site.zip` file generated by `npm run build:zip`
   - Wait for the upload to complete
   - Your site will be deployed automatically

3. **Site Configuration (Optional):**
   - Set a custom domain if desired
   - Configure environment variables if needed
   - Set up form handling if required

## Important Notes

- The `_redirects` file ensures proper SPA routing and lives at `public/_redirects` in source
- The `netlify.toml` file is configured for automatic builds
- All routes will redirect to `index.html` for client-side routing
- The build output is optimized for production with vendor chunking

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a 404 error, ensure the `_redirects` file is in the `dist/` folder (built from `public/_redirects`)
- Check that all assets are properly referenced with relative paths
- Verify the build completed without errors

## Build Output Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html
├── _redirects
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].js
│   ├── index-[hash].css
│   └── vendor-[hash].js
└── [other assets]
```

## One-command helper

Run the helper script which builds, verifies, and produces `site.zip` automatically:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
